Tokenizer:

Given that there is no "main" function, users would simply need to build the
project and utilize the "tokenize(filename)" function. Alternatively, users
could include a main function within the "JottTokenizer.java" file and
call the "tokenize" function from there.

Parser:

Given that there is no "main" function, users would simply need to build the
project and utilize the "parse(tokens" function. Alternatively, users could
include a main function within the "JottParser.java" file and call the "parse"
function from there. This function must be called on a tokenized ArrayList
of Token type.
